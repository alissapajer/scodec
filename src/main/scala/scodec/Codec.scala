/**
 * Supports encoding a value of type `A` to a `BitVector` and decoding a `BitVector` to a value of `A`.
 *
 * Not every value of `A` can be encoded to a bit vector and similarly, not every bit vector can be decoded to a value
 * of type `A`. Hence, both encode and decode return either an error or the result. Furthermore, decode returns the
 * remaining bits in the bit vector that it did not use in decoding.
 *
 * There are various ways to create instances of `Codec`. The trait can be implemented directly or one of the
 * constructor methods in the companion can be used (e.g., `apply`, `derive`). Most of the methods on `Codec`
 * create return a new codec that has been transformed in some way. For example, the [[xmap]] method
 * converts a `Codec[A]` to a `Codec[B]` given two functions, `A => B` and `B => A`.
 *
 * One of the simplest transformation methods is `def withContext(context: String): Codec[A]`, which
 * pushes the specified context string in to any errors (i.e., `Err`s) returned from encode or decode.
 *
 * See the methods on this trait for additional transformation types.
 *
 * See the [[codecs]] package object for pre-defined codecs for many common data types and combinators for building larger
 * codecs out of smaller ones.
 *
 * == Tuple Codecs ==
 *
 * The `~` operator supports combining a `Codec[A]` and a `Codec[B]` in to a `Codec[(A, B)]`.
 *
 * For example: {{{
   val codec: Codec[Int ~ Int ~ Int] = uint8 ~ uint8 ~ uint8}}}
 *
 * Codecs generated with `~` result in left nested tuples. These left nested tuples can
 * be pulled back apart by pattern matching with `~`. For example: {{{
  Codec.decode(uint8 ~ uint8 ~ uint8, bytes) map { case a ~ b ~ c => a + b + c }
 }}}
 *
 * Alternatively, a function of N arguments can be lifted to a function of left-nested tuples. For example: {{{
  val add3 = (_: Int) + (_: Int) + (_: Int)
  Codec.decode(uint8 ~ uint8 ~ uint8, bytes) map add3
 }}}
 *
 * Similarly, a left nested tuple can be created with the `~` operator. This is useful when creating the tuple structure
 * to pass to encode. For example: {{{
  (uint8 ~ uint8 ~ uint8).encode(1 ~ 2 ~ 3)
 }}}
 *
 * Tuple based codecs are of limited use compared to `HList` based codecs, which is discussed later.
 *
 * Note: this design is heavily based on Scala's parser combinator library and the syntax it provides.
 *
 * === flatZip ===
 *
 * Sometimes when combining codecs, a latter codec depends on a formerly decoded value.
 * The `flatZip` method is important in these types of situations -- it represents a dependency between
 * the left hand side and right hand side. Its signature is `def flatZip[B](f: A => Codec[B]): Codec[(A, B)]`.
 * This is similar to `flatMap` except the return type is `Codec[(A, B)]` instead of `Decoder[B]`.
 *
 * Consider a binary format of an 8-bit unsigned integer indicating the number of bytes following it.
 * To implement this with `flatZip`, we could write: {{{
  val x: Codec[(Int, ByteVector)] = uint8 flatZip { numBytes => bytes(numBytes) }
  val y: Codec[ByteVector] = x.xmap[ByteVector]({ case (_, bv) => bv }, bv => (bv.size, bv))
 }}}
 * In this example, `x` is a `Codec[(Int, ByteVector)]` but we do not need the size directly in the model
 * because it is redundant with the size stored in the `ByteVector`. Hence, we remove the `Int` by
 * `xmap`-ping over `x`. The notion of removing redundant data from models comes up frequently.
 * Note: there is a combinator that expresses this pattern more succinctly -- `variableSizeBytes(uint8, bytes)`.
 *
 * == HList Codecs ==
 *
 * `HList`s are similar to tuples in that they represent the product of an arbitrary number of types. That is,
 * the size of an `HList` is known at compile time and the type of each element is also known at compile time.
 * For more information on `HList`s in general, see [[https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless Shapeless]].
 *
 * `Codec` makes heavy use of `HList`s. The primary operation is extending a `Codec[L]` for some `L <: HList` to
 * a `Codec[A :: L]`. For example: {{{
  val uint8: Codec[Int] = ...
  val string: Codec[String] = ...
  val codec: Codec[Int :: Int :: String] = uint8 :: uint8 :: string}}}
 * The `::` method is sort of like cons-ing on to the `HList` but it is doing so *inside* the `Codec` type.
 * The resulting codec encodes values by passing each component of the `HList` to the corresponding codec
 * and concatenating all of the results.
 *
 * There are various methods on this trait that only work on `Codec[L]` for some `L <: HList`. Besides the aforementioned
 * `::` method, there are others like `:::`, `flatPrepend`, `flatConcat`, etc. One particularly useful method is
 * `dropUnits`, which removes any `Unit` values from the `HList`.
 *
 * Given a `Codec[X0 :: X1 :: ... Xn :: HNil]` and a case class with types `X0` to `Xn` in the same order,
 * the `HList` codec can be turned in to a case class codec via the `as` method. For example:
 {{{
  case class Point(x: Int, y: Int, z: Int)
  val threeInts: Codec[Int :: Int :: Int :: HNil] = uint8 :: uint8 :: uint8
  val point: Codec[Point] = threeInts.as[Point]
 }}}
 *
 * === flatPrepend ===
 *
 * The `HList` analog to `flatZip` is `flatPrepend`. It has the signature: {{{
  def flatPrepend[L <: HList](f: A => Codec[L]): Codec[A :: L]
 }}}
 * It forms a codec of `A` consed on to `L` when called on a `Codec[A]` and passed a function `A => Codec[L]`.
 * Note that the specified function must return an `HList` based codec. Implementing our example from earlier
 * using `flatPrepend`: {{{
  val x: Codec[Int :: ByteVector :: HNil] = uint8 flatPrepend { numBytes => bytes(numBytes).hlist }
 }}}
 * In this example, `bytes(numBytes)` returns a `Codec[ByteVector]` so we called `.hlist` on it to lift it
 * in to a `Codec[ByteVector :: HNil]`.
 *
 * There are similar methods for flat appending and flat concating.
 *
 * == Coproduct Codecs ==
 *
 * Given some ordered list of types, potentially with duplicates, a value of the `HList` of those types
 * has a value for *every* type in the list. In other words, an `HList` represents having an `X0` AND `X1` AND
 * ... AND `XN`. A `Coproduct` for the same list of types represents having a value for *one* of those types.
 * In other words, a `Coproduct` represents having an `X0` OR `X1` OR ... OR `XN`. This is somewhat imprecise
 * because a coproduct can tell us exactly which `Xi` we have, even in the presence of duplicate types.
 *
 * A coproduct can also be thought of as an `Either` that has an unlimited number of choices instead of just 2 choices.
 *
 * Shapeless represents coproducts in a similar way as `HList`s. A coproduct type is built using the `:+:` operator
 * with a sentinal value of `CNil`. For example, an `Int` or `Long` or `String` is represented as the coproduct type: {{{
  Int :+: Long :+: String :+: CNil }}}
 *
 * For more information on coproducts in general, see [[https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless Shapeless]].
 *
 * Like `HList` based codecs, scodec supports `Coproduct` based codecs by coopting syntax from Shapeless. Specifically,
 * the `:+:` operator is used: {{{
  val builder = uint8 :+: int64 :+: utf8
 }}}
 * Unlike `HList` based codecs, the result of `:+:` is not a codec but rather a [[codecs.CoproductCodecBuilder]].
 * Having a list of types and a codec for each is not sufficient to build a coproduct codec. We also need to describe
 * how each entry in the coproduct is differentiated from the other entries. There are a number of ways to do this
 * and each way changes the binary format significantly. See the docs on `CoproductCodecBuilder` for details.
 *
 * == Derived Codecs ==
 *
 * Codecs for case classes and sealed class hierarchies can often be automatically derived.
 *
 * Consider this example: {{{
  import scodec.codecs.implicits._
  case class Point(x: Int, y: Int, z: Int)
  Codec[Point].encode(Point(1, 2, 3))
 }}}
 * In this example, no explicit codec was defined for `Point` yet `Codec[Point]` successfully created one.
 * It did this by "reflecting" over the structure of `Point` and looking up a codec for each component type
 * (note: no runtime reflection is performed - rather, this is implemented using macro-based compile time reflection).
 * In this case, there are three components, each of type `Int`, so it looked for an implicit `Codec[Int]`.
 * It then combined each `Codec[Int]` using an `HList` based codec and finally converted the `HList` codec
 * to a `Codec[Point]`. It found the implicit `Codec[Int]` instances due to the import of `scodec.codecs.implicits._`.
 * Furthermore, if there was an error encoding or decoding a field, the field name (i.e., x, y, or z) is included
 * as context on the `Err` returned.
 *
 * This works similarly for sealed class hierarchies -- each subtype is internally represented as a member
 * of a coproduct. There must be the following implicits in scope however:
 *  - `Discriminated[A, D]` for some discriminator type `D`, which provides the `Codec[D]` to use for encoding/decoding
 *     the discriminator
 *  - `Discriminator[A, X, D]` for each subtype `X` of `A`, which provides the discriminator value for type `X`
 *  - `Codec[X]` for each subtype `X` of `A`
 *
 * Full examples are available in the test directory of this project.
 *
 * Note that both case class and sealed hierarchies require implicit component codecs in scope. In both cases,
 * those implicit codecs can themselves be automatically derived, although diverging implicit expansion
 * errors often occur when recursively deriving codecs. These errors can be avoided by lifting derived
 * codecs for the component types to implicit codecs like so: {{{
 case class Foo(x: Bar, y: Baz, ...)
 implicit val codecBar = Codec.derive[Bar]
 implicit val codecBaz = Codec.derive[Baz]
 Codec.derive[Foo] }}}
 *
 * === Implicit Codecs ===
 *
 * Codecs derived automatically are not defined implicitly -- meaning that if `Codec.derive[Foo]` returns
 * a derived codec, that derived codec will not be available via `implicitly[Codec[Foo]]`. Instead,
 * derived codecs are provided implicitly via the [[DerivedCodec]] witness. In fact, `Codec.derive[A]`
 * is just an implicit summoning method for `DerivedCodec[A]`.
 *
 * When writing generic combinators that depend on implicitly available codecs, it is often useful
 * to allow for fallback to a derived codec if there is no explicitly defined implicit codec available.
 * This support is provided by the [[ImplicitCodec]] witness. Instead of requesting an implicit `Codec[A]`,
 * request an `ImplicitCodec[A]` to get the fallback to derived behavior.
 *
 * == Miscellaneous ==
 *
 * Note: the decode function can be lifted to a state action via `StateT[Err \/ ?, BitVector, A]`. This type alias
 * and associated constructor is provided by `[[DecodingContext]]`.
